//Note by Melissa: Used to store user info, like settings, default states, etc.
    //we can use this to check if the app has launched before
    //and also if the user is current logged in or logged out
//Also note by Melissa!!: This map (mapping username to email for login) might have to be stored in firebase or something; storing this dict on the phone would mean that if the user has never logged in before on a different device, there is no way to login with just their username because the phone has not mapped their username to an email before
